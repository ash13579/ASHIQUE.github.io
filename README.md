# My Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built from my resume. The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience with deploying a static website from scratch using **GitHub Pages**.

## Project Overview

This project was a step-by-step journey from concept to a deployable website:

1.  **Objective**: Learn the end-to-end process of hosting a static website for free.
2.  **Content Sourcing**: My professional resume was used as the source material for the website's content.
3.  **Development**:
    * `index.html`: Created to structure the resume content semantically for the web.
    * `style.css`: Developed to provide a clean, modern, and responsive design for the portfolio.
4.  **Outcome**: The repository now contains a complete, single-page portfolio website ready for deployment.
